## Why use Object Pooling

This design pattern is to be kept in mind to help in relieving the processing power to handle more input tasks and not become difficult by repetitive create and destroy calls. 

Object pooling is used when the rate of initializing an instance of the class is high

Example: This can be useful when dealing with bullets in a top-down shooter game.
